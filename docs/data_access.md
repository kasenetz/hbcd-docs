## Review
This is the step where the DUC committee (NIDA) reviews your request. When your request is approved, you will receive an email notifying you of the approval. After signing in to the platform, you will have access to the requested data. If your DUC request is denied, your access to the platform will be limited, but you will be allowed to submit a new DUC request.

Please note: For beta testing, users do not have to undergo any additional training. But for the public release, each user needs to go through a mandatory training on responsible data use before accessing the data.
