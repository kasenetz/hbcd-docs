<p>All individuals can typically obtain their own data access, including graduate students, postdocs, and similar roles. However, it's ultimately up to your institution to decide whether they will co-sign an independent DUC.</p>
<p>Group-Level DUC is generally recommended, where principal investigators (PI) submit a single DUC that includes trainees, lab members, and collaborators (adding or removing users is managed via user dashboard). The lead investigator is responsible for ensuring that individuals added as part of a group-level DUC are in compliance with its terms and conditions. Note that it is essential for the primary DUC holder to renew annually, as expiration will result in access being revoked for all listed collaborators.</p>

<div class="notification-collapsible-content">
<br>
<p>It is prohibited to input HBCD data into generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) because doing so would violate the terms of the data use agreement. These agreements strictly limit access to approved individuals to protect sensitive information. Generative AI tools process input data in ways that may result in unauthorized access or unintended use, making them unsuitable for handling restricted data.</p>

<p>Fields reporting age in the tabulated data include global, single-point (i.e. static) variables in Basic Demographics (see details <a href="../datacuration/phenotypes/#demo-age">here</a>), e.g. <b>Maternal Age at V01</b>, and instrument-specific variables for age (see details <a href="../datacuration/phenotypes/#instrument-age">here</a>) that vary depending on the date of administration for a given instrument.</p>
<p>For the <a href="../datacuration/rawbids">raw BIDS</a> data (EEG, magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscropy, and motion sensor data), metrics for age are reported in the session- and scan-level <code>.tsv</code> files.

<div id="faq-underscores" class="notification-banner" onclick="toggleCollapse(this)">
  <span class="emoji"><i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i></span>
  <span class="text">What is the significance of single versus double underscores in table and field names?</span>
  <span class="notification-arrow">▸</span>
</div>
<div class="notification-collapsible-content">
<br>
<p>Instrument table and field names may contain either single or double underscores. For example: <code>ncl_ch_mlds</code> (MLDS) vs <code>ncl_cg_spm2__inf</code> (SPM-2) <a href="../measures/neurocog/#neurocognition-language">Neurocognition & Language</a> instruments. The double underscore (<code>__</code>) originates from instances where a table name or field previously contained <code>_i_</code>, which was later removed in the Data Release process. When <code>_i_</code> was removed, it was replaced by a double underscore.</p> 
<p>In terms of its significance, in some cases single underscores (<code>_</code>) are used at a higher level in the hierarchy and help distinguish between scales and sub-scale counters across different instruments. <i>However</i>, a unified naming scheme has not yet been employed in the current release, so this will not be consistent across variables. Future releases aim to implement a standardized naming scheme for consistency.</p>

  <span class="text">When should I use EPI fieldmaps?  </span>
  <span class="notification-arrow">▸</span>
</div>
<div class="notification-collapsible-content">
<br>
<p>HBCD image processing pipelines use field maps to perform distortion correction for structural and functional MRI data. Most researchers will likely use the processed data for their analyses and therefore do not need to use the fieldmaps for anything, as all pipeline output derivatives are already distortion corrected. However, if using the <a href="../datacuration/rawbids">raw BIDS data</a> for your research, note that each fMRI acquisition will have a specific pair of fieldmaps associated with it, acquired in AP and PA phase encoding directions, located under <code>fmap/</code>. The matching EPI fieldmaps can easily be identified by the run number, specified by <code>run-&lt;label&gt;</code> in the filename (see details <a href="../datacuration/rawbids/#functional-func-and-fieldmaps-fmap">here</a>).

<p>Quality control (QC) metrics derived from automated and manual raw data QC procedures (described in the section <a href="../measures/mri/qc/#raw-mr-data-qc">Raw MR Data QC</a>) are provided for each scan in the session-level <code>scans.tsv</code> file (see details <a href="../datacuration/rawbids/#scan-level-data">here</a>). A sampling approach was used to select a subset of data for manual review based on the automated QC metrics. Therefore, while automated QC metrics are available for all scans, not all will include manual QC metrics in the <code>scans.tsv</code> file. Also note that although the <code>QC</code> field is the overall manual QC score of 1 (pass) or 0 (fail), this field will automatically have a score of 1 if manual QC was not performed.</p>

<br>
<p>Only imaging data that have passed quality control (QC) and compliance checks are included in this release. To help researchers make informed decisions, QC metrics are provided in various formats. Please refer to the following sections in the Release Notes for more details:</p>

<b>Raw Imaging Data:</b> 
<ul>
<li>Only data that meet QC standards, as described in <a href="../measures/mri/qc/#raw-mr-data-qc">Raw MR Data QC</a>, are included.</li>
<li>QC metrics for raw data are available in the <code>sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_scans.tsv</code> file within each subject session folder under <code>rawdata/</code>. See <a href="../datacuration/rawbids/#scan-level-data">Raw BIDS Data &gt; Scan-Level Data</a> for details.</li>
<li>Additional exclusion criteria include acquisition parameter checks and processing pipeline requirements (see <a href="../datacuration/exclusions/#imaging-spectroscopy-eeg-accelerometry">Exclusion Criteria</a>).</li>
<li>Structural and functional MRI data undergo MRIQC processing to generate image quality metrics. See <a href="../datacuration/derivatives/#mriqc-mriqc">MRIQC derivatives</a> overview for more information. Researchers may use these outputs for further curation if needed.</li>
</ul>

<b>Processed ("Derivative") Imaging Data:</b> 
<ul>
<li>Included raw data are processed through pipelines that generate analysis-ready derivatives.</li>
<li>Processing pipelines, such as <a href="../datacuration/derivatives/#xcp-d-xcp_d">XCP-D</a> (for structural and functional MRI) and <a href="../datacuration/derivatives/#qsiprep-qsiprep">QSIPrep</a> (for diffusion MRI), produce visual reports that can help guide data selection.</li>

  <span class="text">Why is the cerebellum sometimes cut off in functional and diffusion MRI scans?</span>
  <span class="notification-arrow">▸</span>
</div>
<div class="notification-collapsible-content">
<br>
<p>Due to the relatively limited brain coverage in dMRI and fMRI acquisitions, the superior or inferior edges of the brain may occasionally fall outside the slice stack, referred to as field of view (FOV) cutoff. In cases where the cutoff is extreme (>30% of the image), the dMRI and fMRI series fail QC and are therefore excluded from inclusion in the data release. However, mild (<10%) to moderate (10–30%) FOV cutoff does not lead to QC failure. Brain regions outside of the FOV will have missing values in the tabulated imaging data, but the remaining areas remain usable. Automated post-processing QC metrics provide measurements of superior and inferior FOV cutoff, which researchers use for the exclusion of participants with significant FOV cutoff from analyses. See <a href="../measures/mri/qc/#hbcd-raw-mri-data-qc">HBCD Raw MRI Data QC</a> in the Release Notes for a description of automated and manual quality control procedures for raw imaging data.</p>
