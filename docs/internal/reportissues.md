# Reporting Issues (WGs only)

*NOTE: This section will not be included in the final webpage for the release, but instead offers a central location for internal documentation to assist HBCD researchers and stakeholders in preparation for the release.*

## Lasso Help Center
Please use the Lasso Help Center to report: 

- Any issues with your data.
- Any issues in the Data Dictionary for your WG’s measures.
- Any feedback or feature requests to improve the ease and effectiveness of querying and analyzing data. 
- Any bugs that you may encounter in Lasso.

Follow the instructions outlined in [Report Issues](../reportissue.md) to submit a help desk ticket. If you are having trouble accessing the help center in Lasso, please reach out to **achaudhry@lassoinformatics.com** and/or **lmacintyre@lassoinformatics.com**

## Updates to HBCD Data Release webpage content

If you identify any errors or updates required to sections of the [HBCD Data Release](https://hbcd-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) webpage, particularly [Release Notes > Data Measures](https://hbcd-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/measures/), or have suggestions, please report them using one of the following methods:

1. Submit an issue via [hbcd-docs GitHub](https://github.com/DCAN-Labs/hbcd-docs/issues) 
2. Contact me, Luci Moore, directly via Slack or email (for more complex updates requiring discussion, Slack or email is preferred)
3. Submit a ticket to the Lasso Help Center (select "Unsure" under Category)

*Please note: I am unable to address specific questions about the content itself, but I can implement updates if, for example, the information provided by your Workgroup was inaccurately incorporated, information is missing, etc. I also receive updates through other channels (e.g., Workgroup README templates) and strive to incorporate changes promptly upon notification. However, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have questions or concerns.*
