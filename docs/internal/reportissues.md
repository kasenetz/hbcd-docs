# Reporting Issues (WGs only)

*NOTE: This section will not be included in the final webpage for the release, but instead offers a central location for internal documentation to assist HBCD researchers and stakeholders in preparation for the release.*

## Lasso Help Center
Please use the Lasso Help Center to report: 

- Any issues with your data.
- Any issues in the Data Dictionary for your WG’s measures.
- Any feedback or feature requests to improve the ease and effectiveness of querying and analyzing data. 
- Any bugs that you may encounter in Lasso.

Follow the instructions outlined in [Report Issues](../reportissue.md) to submit a help desk ticket. If you are having trouble accessing the help center in Lasso, please reach out to **achaudhry@lassoinformatics.com** and/or **lmacintyre@lassoinformatics.com**

## Updates to HBCD Data Release webpage content

If you identify any errors or updates required to sections of this webpage or have suggestions, please report them using one of the following methods:

1. Submit an issue via [hbcd-docs GitHub](https://github.com/DCAN-Labs/hbcd-docs/issues) 
2. Contact me, Luci Moore, directly via Slack or email (for more complex updates requiring discussion, Slack or email is preferred)
3. Submit a ticket to the Lasso Help Center (select "Unsure" under Category)

*Please note: I am unable to address specific questions about the content itself, but I can implement updates if, for example, the information provided by your Workgroup was inaccurately incorporated, information is missing, etc. I also receive updates through other channels (e.g., Workgroup README templates) and strive to incorporate changes promptly upon notification. However, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have questions or concerns.*
