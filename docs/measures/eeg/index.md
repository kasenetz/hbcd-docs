# Electroencephalogram (EEG)
EEG tasks are acquired during visits V03, V04, and V06. For full details on the HBCD EEG protocol, please refer to [Fox et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101447) published in the Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience special issue on HBCD.

## Quality Control    
After EEG acquisition, quality control checks are performed using [EEG2BIDS Wizard](https://github.com/aces/eeg2bids), a custom MATLAB application installed at all HBCD sites. These checks are immediately provided to the user to ensure the data's integrity and usability. The process includes:

- Verifying event markers in the EEG data to confirm all required events are accurately recorded.
- Ensuring the setup for stimulus presentation and EEG data acquisition adheres to the study protocol.
- Inspecting electrode impedances to ensure they are within acceptable limits.
- Detecting multiple task runs and incomplete recordings.
- Confirming the use of correct E-Prime task versions.

Both study sites and the EEG Core team use an EEG Quality Control dashboard developed by LORIS to access and monitor incoming EEG data and QC metrics, such as retained epochs and line noise levels. Outputs from the HBCD-Maryland Analysis of Developmental EEG ([HBCD-MADE](https://github.com/DCAN-Labs/HBCD-MADE)) pipeline, which handles preprocessing and data cleaning, are also integrated into the dashboard. These outputs include key metrics like outlier statistics for specific task epochs ([Debnath et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13580)). Regular site-specific check-ins and troubleshooting are conducted to ensure consistent protocol adherence and data quality across sites. For a detailed description of QC procedures in the HBCD Study EEG protocol, refer to [Fox et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101447).

During quality control, a frequently observed issue across all tasks was the irregular application of EEG sensors. Additionally, partial task completion due to infant fussing and missing stimulus flags were commonly noted for the faces and auditory mismatch negativity tasks.

### EEG Net Placement ("Capping Quality") Ratings
EEG capping quality ratings are used to determine inclusion in the data release pool and subsequent processing. Photos are taken for each acquisition from the front, back, top, left, and right angles of the participant's head and uploaded via the BIDS Wizard application to a secure computing environment. They are then reviewed by the EEG Core at the University of Maryland to rate the quality of EEG net placement, or "capping quality," for each acquisition. EEG data determined as unusable due to capping quality are not included in the initial public data release, as noted under [Exclusion Criteria > EEG](../../datacuration/exclusions.md#eeg). 

“Average”, "Poor," and "Not usable" ratings correspond to net placement shifted 1-2 cm, 2-3 cm, and >3 cm from proper placement, respectively. To be rated as "Excellent," acquisitions must meet the following criteria:

1.	Net placement is symmetrical with midline electrodes centered on the scalp
2.	Ears are within the ear holes and not covered by sensors 
3.	Reference electrode is placed on the vertex of the scalp
4.	Electrode E17 is placed on the nasion

Please refer to the [Official EEG Acquisition Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tjrFJzntHOqJOrq-SRGy2Z0LOj56MFsZ2ZocgrUogSs/edit?usp=sharing) for additional information about capping requirements.

<p>The HBCD EEG data and EEG preprocessing outputs do not contain any personally identifiable information. It is important to consider that potentially stigmatizing conclusions could emerge from the inappropriate use of the EEG data together with available demographic information or questionnaires (for commentary on this from the ABCD study, see <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01608-4">Cardenas-Iniguez et al., 2024</a>). Furthermore, all EEG tasks are all passive at the V03 age range and therefore conclusions should not be drawn about behavioral performance.</p> 
<p>Methodologically, there are a number of best practices for responsible data use that will be included with each file. The first is selecting files that maintain a minimum trial threshold recommendation. For each task, there are three levels of quality control thresholds that can be used: (1) our QC thresholds used to provide feedback to sites on each upload, (2) a 30% trial retention threshold (which we use internally to indicate usability of an EEG recording), and (3) the reliability recommendations for each task.</p>
<p><li>Threshold recommendations by task:</li>
<li>RS - 108 trials</li>
<li>FACE - 15 trials for each condition of interest</li>
<li>MMN - 30 trials for each condition of interest</li>
<li>VEP - 36 trials.</li></p>
<p>As a second consideration, researchers should only select files that have usable net application, as proper placement of the REF and COM electrodes is the ground truth for all localizable, cluster specific EEG analyses. As such, we recommend excluding the files denoted as having “unusable” net application in the QC outputs for each task.</p>
<p>An additional consideration for responsible use of the HBCD EEG dataset applies to disproportionate missing data. It is possible that some participant data may be systematically excluded from this dataset by virtue of not meeting the QC thresholds. For instance, with infants that are inattentive and prone to fussing out during the EEG recording, more data may be removed from their datasets by our preprocessing scripts. A similar risk holds with participants historically underrepresented in EEG research due to racial and cultural differences in hairstyling and texture which may impact capping success, impedance, and data quality (Adams et al., 2024). The consortium has proactively worked to address this risk by using culturally-sensitive scheduling procedures and by purchasing 3 long pedestal nets per site in sizes appropriate for the V03, V04, and V06 visits (Adams et al., 2024; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101396">Mlandu et al., 2024</a>). Preliminary analyses indicate that capping quality for visits where the long pedestal net was used have been consistent with capping quality seen for the dataset at large.</p>
<p>A final recommendation for best practices in the use of the HBCD EEG data pertains to culturally and racially sensitive hypothesis formulation, analyses, and communication of findings. It is important to use these data in a manner which takes into account that physical and neurological differences between groups are not necessarily representative of intrinsic qualities of a given racial or ethnic group. Stigmatizing language should be avoided and discussions around data patterns should be sensitive to societal and historical factors. In addition, it is important to note that variation within historically designated populations (i.e. racial and cultural subpopulations) is greater than variation across populations. Demographic markers are categorical proxies that cannot capture or explain the causal mechanisms that may account for evident differences. As such, we suggest following the guidelines presented in the linked Nature Neuroscience article, “Recommendations for the responsible use and communication of race and ethnicity in neuroimaging research” (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01608-4">Cardenas-Iniguez et al., 2024</a>).</p>

### Faces Task
The Faces task (v.11.29.23) is used to assess neural activity supporting face and object processing within the first years of life. It assesses child and infant face processing development including attention, perception, categorization, individuation and memory. The measure includes rigorous QC procedures to ensure data integrity and reliability. To assess child and infant face processing abilities as well as the underlying neural activity supporting face and object processing, the task involves 2 blocks: 50 trials of upright faces & 50 trials of inverted faces and 50 trials of upright faces & 50 trials of objects. If the child loses attention, an attention getter may be played to bring the child’s focus back to the task.     
   
**Face task schematic (Face vs. Object)**<br>

ERPs are computed as a function of repeated presentation of faces and objects. The ERPs index different stages of processing including attention, perception, categorization, individuation and memory. The ERP components elicited by the Faces task are the P1, N290, and P400 components. See [Fox et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101447) for additional information on the rationale for task/stimulus development and ERP findings from pilot data.

<p>Researchers should be aware that the interstimulus interval (ISI) was updated between V03 and V04/V06. Please see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101447">Fox et al. 2024</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/00003446-200204000-00005">Morr et al. 2002</a> for details.</p>

The Auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) Task (v.11.29.23) provides a comprehensive assessment of infant speech sound processing and includes rigorous QC procedures to ensure data integrity and reliability. The MMN facilitates examining auditory evoked potentials and habituation/dishabituation to auditory stimuli by capturing differences in neural responses to standard (“ba”) and deviant (“da”) stimuli. During auditory presentation of syllables, a video is played on an iPad as a distractor (with brightness all the way up, in airplane mode, and not plugged in). From this task the MMN difference wave is computed, which is also known as the Mismatch Response (MMR). The amplitude/latency of this difference wave has been linked to language (Choudhury & Benasich, 2011), temperament/personality (Gurrera et al., 2001; Marshall et al., 2009), internalizing problems (Reeb-Sutherland et al., 2009), externalizing/attention problems (Gumenyuk et al., 2005), and disorders including autism (Lepistö et al., 2005; Schwartz et al., 2018) and reading ability/dyslexia (Leppänen et al., 2010; Norton, Beach, et al., 2021). See [Fox et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101447) for more information about the MMN task.   

### Video Resting State (RS)

<p>Researchers should be aware that the video content for the video RS task was modified between V03 and V04/V06.</p> 
</div>
</p>

The Video Resting State (v.11.29.23) task provides assessment of the development of large scale neural networks during infancy and early childhood via information about neural oscillations measured in EEG power across the scalp. Developmental changes in oscillatory activity reflect underlying developing large scale neural networks associated with early self-regulatory, cognitive, and affective processes and developmental outcomes (Gabard-Durnam et al., 2019; E. J. Jones et al., 2020; Whedon et al., 2020). The metrics derived from the resting EEG signal include power across the frequency spectrum (Gabard-Durnam et al., 2019) and relative power between different scalp locations (Davidson & Fox, 1982). See [Fox et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101447) for more information about the RS.       

In V03, a silent video plays with a variety of colorful and abstract toys and visuals on screen. The child watches the video for the duration of the task:

In V04/6, a silent video plays with a variety of marble run and construction visuals on screen. The child watches the video for the duration of the task:

***Users should be aware that, as noted in the title, this is not a true resting state as there is a visual stimulus present.***

### Visual Evoked Potential Task (VEP)
The Visual Evoked Potential Task (v.11.29.23) measures development of visual cortex and response to stimuli, reflecting underlying cortical development via measurement of cortical responses to flashing checkerboard visual stimuli, shown for the duration of the task: 
![VEP checkerboard image](images/eeg-vep-checkerboard.png)

VEP amplitude and latency decreases with age during the first three years of life. The VEP has been associated with concurrent and later developmental outcomes as a function of prenatal substance exposures (Margolis et al., 2024), early visual enrichment or deprivation (Jensen et al., 2019), vision system maturation (Lippé et al., 2009), neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., ASD and ADHD; Cremone- Caira et al., 2023; Nazhvani et al., 2013), and reading and learning disabilities (Shandiz et al., 2017). The morphology of the VEP likely reflects varying degrees of synaptic efficiency and as such, can be used as a readout of general cortical function. The task elicits a VEP response in the occipital area (Oz), consisting of the, N1 (first negative peak), P1 (first positive peak), and N2 (second negative peak) components. See [Fox et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101447) for more information about the VEP task.
