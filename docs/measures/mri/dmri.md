**Full Name**: Diffusion MRI  
**Acronym/Brief Names**: dMRI, diffusion

A scanner-harmonized multishell diffusion-weighted imaging protocol was implemented across all platforms for both spatial (1.7 mm isotropic) and timing parameters (TR/TE = 4800/88 ms) and a multiband factor of 3.  Diffusion-weighted images were obtained across multiple b-values (directions)  with the following:  b = 0 (n=20); 500 (n=12); 1000 (n=24); 2000 (n=36); 3000 s/mm^2 (n=58).  The diffusion encodings were split across A/P and P/A phase encoding series to distribute EPI distortion effects across the diffusion-weighting.  The total acquisition time for both diffusion-weighted imaging series was about 12.5 minutes.  Acquisition failure was deemed for cases that collected less than 60% of the total diffusion encoded images.
