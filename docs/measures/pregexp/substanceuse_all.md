The list of substances for the Assist measures was greatly expanded. For each substance, participants indicated their frequency of use with options: 0 (Never), 1 (Once or Twice), 2 (Monthly), 3 (Weekly), or 4 (Daily or Almost Daily). For substances reported as used, participants were asked about modes of use, typical quantities of consumption for alcohol and opiods (if applicable), and disordered or problematic use - please see HBCD Modifications for details. Any reported use within three months before or during pregnancy triggered the Time Line Follow Back (TLFB).

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>TLFB</b></p>
When triggered by Assist responses, the [Time Line Follow Back (TLFB)](https://cde.nida.nih.gov/sites/nida_cde/files/TimeLineFollowBack_2014Mar24.pdf) was modified (see <a href="#hbcd-modifications">HBCD Modifications</a>) to record maternal substance use before and during pregnancy. Participants reported use during 9 weeks in total for each product type (e.g., edible cannabis) reported on the ASSIST. The sampled weeks included: pre-pregnancy use (Weeks 1-2: four weeks to two weeks before LMP), early pregnancy use (Weeks 3-6: two to six weeks after LMP), and current use (Week 7: the week prior to V1). The TLFB was repeated at V2 to capture substance use during the last two full weeks of gestation (Weeks 8-9).

## HBCD Modifications
<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Assist V1/V2/V3</b></p>

The **Assist V1, V2, & V3 measures** were created from combining the Family History Assessment Module (FHAM) and the All of Us Personal and Family Health History, which was then modified from the [NIDA Quick Screen (Modified Assist)](https://nida.nih.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/nmassist.pdf). The original quick screen was scored; however, our version is not scored. To acknowledged these changes in future publications, authors can note that questions were motivated from the NIDA Modified Assist.

<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Instruction/Assessment Item Modifications</b></p>  
The NIDA quick screen tool (*have you used alcohol, tobacco, prescription drugs, or illegal drugs in the last year*) was removed and replaced by questions to assess more details regarding substances used and the timeline of their use before and during pregnancy. Please expand each section below to see specifics on added options/questions:

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>TLFB</b></p>
The [original TLFB](https://cde.nida.nih.gov/sites/nida_cde/files/TimeLineFollowBack_2014Mar24.pdf) is designed to cover the last 7 days from when the survey is administered and was adapted for HBCD to instead cover timeframes appropriate for Visit 1 (LMP - 4 through LMP - 2, LMP + 2 through LMP + 6, and the week before enrollment (V1)) and Visit 2 (he last two full weeks before delivery, masking the child’s DOB). Daily usage frequency was recorded for all products except for cigarettes/cigarillos (count per day) and alcohol (single servings per day).

## Quality Control & Known Issues
For all measures, QC procedures involved review of response distributions (crossed with TLFB for Assist V1/V2 and vice versa) for outlier detection. One common issue noted was that reported substances used on the TLFB were not always noted on the Assist V1/V2, which triggered a query to the site to correct it. 

Subject matter experts note that it was difficult for some participants to self-report the typical size of a single drink (in oz) to capture ‘standard drinks’ of alcohol for Assist. Some reports are therefore outside expected range. In addition, occasions of substance use is difficult to report for substances such as electronic cigarette devices, also resulting in outliers. Sites were queried on outliers, but participants were not always able to be re-contacted. 

For the TLFB, note that it samples only specific weeks before (Weeks 1-2) and during (Weeks 3-9) pregnancy. As a result, substance use could be reported during pregnancy, but may not appear in the TLFB if it falls outside these sampled weeks. Likewise, a positive biospecimen could lack corresponding TLFB data for the same reason. This sampling method — covering periods before, early, mid, and late pregnancy — aims to reduce participant burden (avoiding a full 40-week TLFB) while capturing key pregnancy phases when behaviors tend to shift (i.e. before and after pregnancy recognition and late pregnancy). 

The TLFB data should be combined with the biospecimen and Assist data. One could also create trajectories of use from the TLFB with assumptions by using data on early pregnancy (weeks 3-6) carried forward until stated pregnancy recognition (V1 Health), then using enrollment (week 7) information and carrying that forward until late pregnancy (weeks 8-9).
