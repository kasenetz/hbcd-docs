# Personal and Family Psychiatric History 
**Full Name**: Personal and family psychiatric history   
**Acronym/Brief Name**: FAM MH  
**Construct**: Personal and family mental health   
**Description**: Captures maternal, paternal, and grandparents’ mental health conditions and diagnoses 
    
This measure was created from combining and modifying the [Family History Assessment Module (FHAM)](https://arc.psych.wisc.edu/self-report/family-history-assessment-module-fham/) and the [All of Us Personal and Family Health History](https://www.researchallofus.org/wp-content/themes/research-hub-wordpress-theme/media/2023/PaFHH_Survey_English.pdf). It assesses self-reported diagnoses and mental health conditions of the biologic mother, father, maternal parents and paternal parents.

## HBCD Modifications
For future publications, authors should note that this measure, as noted in the prior section, is a combination of FHAM and All of Us. It is also not a scored scale, but simply descriptive for family history.

<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Instruction/Assessment Item Modifications</b></p>
From FHAM, only alcohol-schizophrenia were selected; items for Antisocial Personality Disorder and Undifferentiated Psychiatric Disorder were not included. Additionally, ‘trouble with law’ and ‘nervous breakdown’ were excluded.
From All of Us, we were only interested in a few mental health outcomes (AUD, anxiety, ASD, BPD, depression, SUD, schizophrenia and ADHD) and were not interested in age of diagnosis or medications to treat.

<p style="font-size: 1em; margin: 0 0 5px;"><b>Answer/Response Option Changes</b></p>
For FHAM response options (originally including 'parents', 'grandparents', 'siblings', 'aunts', 'uncles', and 'cousins') were modified to include only biological mom, dad and grandparents. For All of Us, response options (originally 'mom', 'dad', 'sibling', 'daughter', 'son', and 'grandparent') were modified to include only biological mom and dad.

## Quality Control & Known Issues
Response distributions were reviewed for outliers and no common issues were identified. In addition, no potential issues were flagged by subject matter experts.
