<p>When writing about mental health symptoms or diagnoses, it is important to use person-centered language. One exception to this is in the area of autism, where there is ongoing dialogue within the affected community about preferred language. It is important to take guidance from those with lived experiences and professional stakeholders when considering any language. Please see the following resources:</p>

<p>Many mental health diagnoses and experiences with mental health care can be influenced by cultural and structural factors that could impact the interpretation of items (symptoms), as well as influenced by previous diagnoses assigned by providers outside the ABCD Study. These cultural and structural factors should be acknowledged, as appropriate.</p>

<p>We recommend statistically examining measurement invariance in mental health measures, considering whether scales and individual items function similarly across demographic groups, and carefully considering the use of measures when bias is demonstrated. It is important for researchers to explicitly acknowledge: (1) potential sources of bias, (2) issues with the measure given evidence of measurement invariance, and/or (3) interpretation limitations that may stem from the use of a given measure.</p>

<p>We recommend following these recommendations for the responsible use and communication of race and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01608-4">ethnicity</a>.</p>

**Full Name**: DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 and Level 2 (version 8a) Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure—Adult   
**Acronym/Brief Name**: APA 1/2  
**Construct**: Mental health   
     
This is a highly sensitive screening tool for use in community samples. It combines two measures: the [DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure—Adult](https://www.psychiatry.org/getmedia/e0b4b299-95b3-407b-b8c2-caa871ca218d/APA-DSM5TR-Level1MeasureAdult.pdf) and the DSM-5 Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures:

![](images/DSM-5Level2Cross-CuttingSymptomMeasures.png)

The mental health screening instrument has two levels. Level 1 includes one to two questions for each of thirteen mental health conditions. When symptoms were reported for Level 1, the participant answered several subsequent questions pertaining to additional symptoms associated with each mental health condition, including anger, anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms, and sleep problems. Slight modifications were made due to the use of other measures and the study population (see [HBCD Modifications](#hbcd-modifications) for details). Alerts for study staff were triggered when APA suicide ('Thoughts of actually hurting yourself?') and/or APA depression (from 'I felt worthless' to 'I felt that nothing could cheer me up') were scored greater than 0 and 32, respectively.

## HBCD Modifications
The APA 1/2 measure was modified to account for the use of other measures and the study population. Level 1 questions for personality functioning and substance use (as this is queried in other measures) were removed to proceed automatically to LEVEL 2—Repetitive Thoughts and Behaviors—Adult (adapted from the Florida Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory [FOCI] Severity Scale [Part B]). All participants answer the level 1 questions on depression, but proceed to level 2 questions irrespective of answers. Gates were also removed from ‘Somatic symptoms’ to go straight to ‘LEVEL 2—Somatic Symptom—Adult (Patient Health Questionnaire 15 Somatic Symptom Severity [PHQ-15]).’

In addition, the option ‘refuse to answer’ was added to all questions. Note that this does not impact scoring (questions answered with ‘refuse to answer’ are skipped). To acknowledged these changes in future publications: removal of Level 1-2 substance use (section XIII) as well as gates for sections V (somatic) and XII (personality) should be noted.

## Quality Control & Known Issues 
Response distributions were reviewed for outliers and no common issues were identified. No potential issues were flagged by subject matter experts.
