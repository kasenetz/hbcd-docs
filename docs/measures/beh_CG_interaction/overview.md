# Overview

## HBCD Modifications
Alterations were made to ecPROMIS, IBQ-R (VSF)+BI, and MAPS-TL for use of gender-neutral terms. Measure instructions and individuals items that reference gendered pronouns (‘her/him’, ‘she/he’) were changed to “my/the baby/child” or “they/them” as fit for the wording. In addition, “parent” was replaced with “parent/caregiver” where appropriate.

Because the psychometric validation for these measures was done using items from the original measures, future publications should account for and note edits made to individual items as part of HBCD DEI review.

</p>
The original ecPROMIS measure items use the term ‘my child,’ as they are designed for children aged 1 to 5 years. To make them suitable for the pre-V03 age range (3 to 9 months), Dr. Dave Cella and Dr. Courtney Blackwell, developers of ecPROMIS, provided guidance to adapt the items by replacing ‘my child’ with ‘my baby.’

As mentioned in the measure description, in addition to the overall <i>Surgency, Negative Affect and Effortful Control</i> scales derived from the validated IBQ-R-VSF, the HBCD Workgroup and measure experts added a Behavior Inhibition (or Social Fear) scale using items from the long form of the IBQ-R (IBQ-R-LF), including: 
<p>
<ul>
<li>38. When introduced to an unfamiliar adult, how often did the baby hang back from the adult?</li>
<li>39. When introduced to an unfamiliar adult, how often did the baby never “warm up” to the unfamiliar adult?</li>
<li>40. When in the presence of several unfamiliar adults, how often did the baby cry?</li>
<li>41. When in the presence of several unfamiliar adults, how often did the baby continue to be upset for 10 minutes or longer?</li>
<li>42. When visiting a new place, how often did the baby show distress for the first few minutes?</li>
<li>43. When visiting a new place, how often did the baby continue to be upset for 10 minutes or more?</li>
<li>44. When your baby was approached by an unfamiliar person when you and your baby were out (for example, shopping), how often did the baby show distress?</li>
<li>45. When your baby was approached by an unfamiliar person when you and your baby were out (for example, shopping), how often did the baby cry?</li>
<li>46R. When an unfamiliar person came to your home or apartment, how often did your baby allow themselves to be picked up without protest?</li>
<li>47. When an unfamiliar person came to your home or apartment, how often did your baby cry when the visitor attempted to pick them up?</li>
</ul>

## Quality Control & Known Issues  
<ul>
<p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 5px;">QC Procedures:</p>
<li>Examine the range of the child’s age to ensure that it falls within 3-9 months for ecPROMIS/MAPS-TL and 3-18 months for IBQ-R (VSF)+BI</li>
<li>Examine missingness (count the number of items answered for each participant)</li>
<li>Calculate sum scores and means, applying prorated scoring to account for missing data</li>
<li>Generate summary statistics and visualizations for item-level frequencies, age, and scores</li>
<li>Use Calculate Cronbach's Alpha for reliability </li>
</ul>

Common errors noted during QC include incorrect administration ages and prorated scoring not being accurately applied to observations with missing responses. Subject matter experts note that these measures (ecPROMIS, IBQ-R (VSF)+BI, and MAPS-TL) assess normative variability in child behavior and should be considered in relation to the child’s age and developmental context. *This is not a clinical or diagnostic tool*.
