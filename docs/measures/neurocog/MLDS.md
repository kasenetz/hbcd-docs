# Multilingual Language Development Screener
**Full Name**: Multilingual Language Development Screener    
**Acronym/Brief Name**: MLDS    
**Construct**: Multilingual exposure    

This instrument involves a series of questionnaires that assess parental concern regarding the child’s hearing and the presence of English, Spanish, or Other languages in the child’s home and childcare environments. This measure is assessing the child’s exposure to languages and whether there are concerns about the child’s hearing. A series of forced choice questions were used to elicit the responses and slide scales were used to assess the percentage of time a child is exposed to a given language in their various environments (i.e., home, daycare, other family member household, babysitter). Up to ten non-parental childcare arrangements were sampled. The measure was designed to inform the site’s assessment team prior to assessments related to neurocognitive and language functioning. Responses are used to determine who was able to conduct the cognitive and language assessments (i.e., English or Spanish speaking) and to document additional challenges to completing assessments (hearing impairment, other languages). This was a questionnaire developed specifically for HBCD to inform assessment process. Caregivers opt for their child’s assessment to be performed in either English or Spanish for in person performance tasks (i.e., NIH Baby Toolbox, Bayley-4, or Deferred Imitation) by selecting between a forced choice of English or Spanish. For the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDI), an algorithm was used to determine if the CDI is done in English only, English and Spanish, English only, or not at all.

    <li><b>Method of Administration</b>: This measure is completed remotely by caregivers prior to when cognitive and language assessments will be performed. If the caregiver does not complete the assessment remotely, it is conducted at the visit to document the child’s language exposure environments. The instrument can be administered by an RA in person or via video as needed.</li>

### Scoring Procedures
Total days per week and total hours per day were calculated for up to 10 non-parental childcare arrangements (Daycare, With Babysitter, With other family members outside of the household, and Other non-parental childcare arrangement).The language environment for each non-parental childcare arrangement was described based on the percentage of Spanish vs Enlgish spoken in the environment:

| Child's Language Environment | % Spanish/English Spoken |
| - | - |
| Only Spanish | >= 30% Spanish AND < 30% English |
| Only English | >= 30% English AND < 30% Spanish |
| Both Spanish & English<sup>**</sup> | >= 30% Spanish AND >= 30% English |
| Neither | < 30% Spanish AND < 30% English |

<sup>**Pending Steering Committee vote</sup>

 The total frequency of Spanish and English was computed by multiplying the percentage of English and Spanish language provided per environment by the total hours per week in both the home and other care environments. The values are provided for home and for the overall total child experience, combining home and other care environments. 

## Quality Control & Known Issues
For QC, frequency of decline to answer and completeness was monitored during data collection. A common issue identified was that initial data shows that about 10% of questionnaires were not complete.

Subject matter experts remind users that this measure was designed to assess the child’s exposure to language in order to identify which measure should be administered at their next in-person study visit. The measure attempts to quantify the percentage of time that the child is exposed to languages in their home and other caregiving environments. Caregivers estimate the percentage of time and the responses *do not reflect exact values of exposure to a given language*. Caregivers may be unaware of all languages their child is exposed to in all of the child’s environments. The measure does not quantify the child’s interactions in a given language. The information only quantifies an estimate of the amount of time they are in an environment where a given language is spoken. The measure does not quantify the child’s expressive or receptive language skills in a given language.
