# SPM-2
**Full Name**: Sensory Processing Measure – Infant/Toddler    
**Acronym/Brief Name**: SPM-2   
**Construct**: Sensory processing

The SPM-2 is designed to assess whether a child’s nervous system integrates visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, gustatory, vestibular, and proprioceptive sensory information from the body and environment efficiently and effectively.  Effective sensory processing contributes to the development of emotion regulation, motor skills, and social relatedness. Difficulties in the integration of sensory information can hinder the development of these skills and higher-level functions such as learning to plan and organize behaviors. The sensory systems serve as foundation for increasingly more complex behaviors and are critical to development.

This questionnaire asks about the ways the child sensory systems contribute to daily functioning. While reading each question, the caregiver is asked to select whether their child’s behavior during the past month “never, occasionally, frequently, or always” resembles the behavior described. 7 sensory domains are assessed as well as functions related to ideas/planning and social relatedness.

## Quality Control & Known Issues
For QC, a measure expert periodically reviews data capture to ensure that items are being fully completed and scoring is spot checked to assure algorithms are being correctly employed. One common QC issue identified by subject matter experts was that the "Decline to answer" instructions were updated to differentiate from behaviors that have never been seen (i.e. developmentally inappropriate).
