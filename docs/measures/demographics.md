<p>When using HBCD data, all data users must agree to responsible use as described in the DUC. When conceptualizing studies, analyzing data, and communicating findings from studies that use variables such as race, ethnicity, country of origin, and socioeconomic data, it is critical to consider strategies to avoid stigmatization of any groups and perpetuating harmful biases.</p> 
<p>Race and ethnicity are collected as a part of the HBCD protocol to reflect social experiences (i.e. representing social constructs) and should not be conceptualized as as biological, natural, intrinsic, or fixed categories of people. In addition, researchers sometimes use race/ethnicity variables as a proxy for unmeasured social experiences or environmental exposures. HBCD measures a wide variety of social experiences and environmental exposures; in analyzing HBCD data, race/ethnicity should not be used as a proxy for measured variables</p>

**Full Name**: HBCD Demographics V01  
**Acronym/Brief Name**: Demographics  
**Construct**: Basic social characteristics related to the birthing parent, the other biological parent, and their household.  

Demographic information is crucial for understanding the child’s environment and identifying how social, structural, and economic factors influence development over time in a longitudinal study of child development. The HBCD Study demographics survey is designed to gather comprehensive information on socioeconomic status and various demographic factors. Its primary purpose is to capture data on race, ethnicity, nativity, income, education, and occupation, as well as gender identity, sexual orientation, relationship status, primary residence, and household composition of the parent carrying the child, and some basic information on the other biological parent.

  <summary>Description from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101429">Cioffredi et al. 2024:</a></summary>  
<br><i>The HBCD Demographics survey was designed to collect social and economic information including race, ethnicity, nativity, income, maternal education, and occupation, as well as to characterize gender identity, sexual orientation, relationship status, primary residence, and household composition. The household composition matrix asks for details on all household members including age, gender, relationship to the child, relationship to the primary caregiver, and time spent caring for the child. Participants and families who endorse no primary residence, or that they are living in a shelter or treatment facility, are not asked to complete the household matrix. The survey includes a limited set of questions on the child’s “other biological parent” (i.e., race, ethnicity, nativity, education, occupation), provided the respondent endorsed an item indicating that they could answer this set of questions. Although there are no direct questions about the primary caregiver’s spouse/partner in the demographics, details of this relationship can be found within the household composition roster. The questions on Occupation ask for detailed information about exposures to environmental toxicants.</i><br>
<br><i>Careful consideration was given to ensure that questions were inclusive of diverse populations and could capture a wide range of family structures and living situations that may impact child health outcomes. As a result, survey elements available within the PhenX Toolkit and other large-scale NIH studies were reviewed and modified by the Social and Environmental Determinants working group and the HBCD Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee to reduce bias and correct for embedded assumptions of heteronormative nuclear-family structures (see Table with sources below). Future demographics surveys will repeat survey elements from Visit 4 for both the primary caregiver and the child.</i>

## HBCD Modifications
Below are alterations made to demographic constructs, informed by a DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) lens, to capture a more inclusive and accurate breadth of demographic information:

<details>
  <summary>DEI Alterations/Modifications</summary>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Marital & Relationship Status</b> alterations to reduce heteronormative bias:
        <ul>
        <li>Combine "Divorced/Separated"</li>
        <li>"Never Married" replaced by "Single"</li>
        <li>"Member of an Unmarried Couple" replaced by "Partnered"</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Gender Identity</b> alterations to reduce heteronormative bias: Transgender Man/Transgender Woman options moved to primary tier of 2-tier question</li>
      <li><b>Sexual Orientation</b> alterations to reduce heteronormative bias: Inclusion of diverse response options to capture sexual orientation across three dimensions: attraction, identity, and behavior. Participant can select all that apply.</li>
      <li><b>Primary Residence</b> destigmatization of diverse living situations: Inclusion of options for individuals in treatment facilities, shelters, or unhoused</li>
      <li><b>Household Roster</b> alterations to reduce heteronormative bias and nuclear family assumptions:
        <ul>
        <li>Changed "Sex" to "Gender"</li>
        <li>Included Non-Binary and Transexual options for Gender</li>
        <li>Expansion of family/caregiver roles</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Race/Ethnicity</b> and <b>Others Describe You</b>: Inclusion of diverse racial and ethnic categories aligned with proposed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2024/03/28/omb-publishes-revisions-to-statistical-policy-directive-no-15-standards-for-maintaining-collecting-and-presenting-federal-data-on-race-and-ethnicity/">OMB recommendations</a> using a combined race and ethnicity variable with 7 response options (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/01/27/2023-01635/initial-proposals-for-updating-ombs-race-and-ethnicity-statistical-standards 
      ">Federal Register 2023</a>). Participant can select all that apply</li>
      <li><b>Income</b>: Alteration of household income brackets</li>
    </ul>
</details>

## Quality Control & Known Issues
QC was performed by monitoring the data dashboard for variable missingness and data consistency. The only common issue noted was high missingness for income, although this is in line with expectations. Subject matter experts flagged the following as a potential issue with this measure: RA reports show that some participants reported challenges in answering certain questions, such as those related to race and ethnicity (e.g. options did not capture identity) and occupation (i.e. imperfect option for job type and number of hours).
