# Responsible Data Use
When using HBCD data, all data users must agree to responsible use as described in the DUC. When conceptualizing studies, analyzing data, and communicating findings from studies that use variables such as race, ethnicity, country of origin, and socioeconomic data, *it is critical to consider strategies to avoid stigmatization of any groups and perpetuating harmful biases*. 

Race and ethnicity are collected as a part of the HBCD protocol to reflect social experiences (i.e. representing social constructs) *and should not be conceptualized as as biological, natural, intrinsic, or fixed categories of people.* In addition, researchers sometimes use race/ethnicity variables as a proxy for unmeasured social experiences or environmental exposures. HBCD measures a wide variety of social experiences and environmental exposures; in analyzing HBCD data, *race/ethnicity should not be used as a proxy for measured variables.*
