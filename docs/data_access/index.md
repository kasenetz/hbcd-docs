<p>Users may encounter issues with their DUC applications or renewals due to the Biden administration's expansion of Executive Order 13873 of May 15, 2019 (Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain) and Executive Order 14034 of June 9, 2021 (Protecting Americans’ Sensitive Data from Foreign Adversaries) that, among other things, prohibits the sharing of Americans’ bulk personal data, including genomic data, in certain cases. The ABCD Study has reported issues for users from countries identified in the Executive Order (see <a href="https://wiki.abcdstudy.org/">ABCD Wiki 11.6.2024: Data Access Issues</a>) and it will likely impact HBCD as well.</p>

HBCD data is publicly shared with all researchers associated with an NIH-recognized research institution via the individual or investigator-led group NBDC Data Use Agreement/Certification (DUC) process, which governs data use for both the ABCD and HBCD studies. The DUC outlines rules that must be followed for data use and is signed electronically by both the submitter and the Institutional Signing Officer at their institution. 

DUC approval is handled by the NIH Brain Development Cohort (NBDC) Data Access Committee (DAC), consisting of federal staff from NIH with expertise in science, policy, or bioinformatics resources. DUCs are approved based on satisfaction of basic pre-requisites and whether the data access request is reasonable and aligns with the terms of the DUC. Note that the quality of the science for which the data is intended to be used is not reviewed.

DUC submission and data access are both conducted through the [NBDC portal supported by Lasso](https://nbdc-hbcd-beta.lassoinformatics.com). This platform enables seamless data queries, downloads, and sharing. The steps for signing onto this platform and submitting a DUC are outlined below.

## DUC Submission: Before You Begin
Before you begin the DUC process, please do the following:

**Make sure that you meet the following access eligibility requirements:**

1. You must have a research-related need to access the data. 
2. You must be associated with an NIH-recognized research institution and have the approval of an authorized signatory official of that institution. Visit [Signing Official (SO)](https://www.era.nih.gov/erahelp/commons/commons/roles/SO.htm) on eRA Commons to learn about institutional signing officials.
3. Your institution must have an active Federalwide Assurance (FWA) 

**Identify an authorized signatory official at your institution**. If you are unsure of who at your institution is an authorized signing official, do not know whether your institution has an FWA, or have any other questions, please email nbdc@mail.nih.gov.

**Decide whether to submit an individual or group-level DUC**. Users may submit either an **individual** or **group-level** DUC. You may submit a DUC either as an individual recipient or submit a group-level DUC as a lead PI with others from your institution listed on the same DUC (recommended). For group-level DUCs, the lead PI must ensure that all listed recipients on the DUC comply with its terms and conditions. *Note: Recipients may only be listed on one DUC.*

**Check whether you will need to submit second DUC.** Recipients who intend to disseminate findings from analyses of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) data separated out from other groups in presentations, pre-prints, publications, website posts, etc. must submit a second DUC governing use of AI/AN data (A-DUC) after obtaining approval on the general DUC. 

## DUC Submission Instructions
### Fill Out DUC Forms
Once you have an account and have logged into the Lasso Informatics platform, please follow these steps to request access to the data.

This will bring you to the the first of three forms of the **Data Use Certification (DUC)** to fill out before review and submission. Fill out the information as follows:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0; font-size: 1.2em"><u>Form 1: Lead Recipient</u></p>
Provide information for all required fields, marked with an asterisk ( * ), including Name, Degree, Institution, and Address. Once complete, select **Continue** (lower right-hand corner of the page).

<p style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0; font-size: 1.2em"><u>Form 2: Research Data Use Statement</u></p>
This form asks you to describe (within a limit of 250 words) why you need access to the dataset. Once complete, select **Continue** (lower right-hand corner of the page).

<p style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0; font-size: 1.2em"><u>Form 3: Authorized Institutional Business Official</u></p>
Provide the (1) name and (2) email address of the Institutional Signing Official for your institution who will be authorizing your access and has signing authority (both fields are mandatory). Once complete, select **Submit** in the lower right-hand corner of the page and the following screen will appear:

    </p>
</ol>

### Review by NBDC DAC
After submitting the DUC, DocuSign automatically notifies the Signing Official at your institution to add their signature, after which it is routed to the NBDC DAC for final review. You will recieve an email notification once approved and be prompted to undergo additional mandatory training on responsible data use after signing into the platform. Once this training is complete, you will have access to the requested data. **Access is valid for one year. To maintain access, recipients must submit a renewal request before the DUC expires.**

## Instructions for Signing Officials
The submitted DUC is required to be signed by a Signing Official in order to be routed to the DAC for final review. Signing Officials receive an automated email from DocuSign asking for their review and signature each time a new DUC is submitted. If you are a Signing Official, please follow the steps below to complete the DUC:

<ol>
    <li>Open the email received from Lasso Informatics via DocuSign.</li>
