<p>The text added to the 'instruction' column in the Data Dictionary metadata are extracted programmatically from the latest instruction field provided in the Data Dictionary of the form based on the order of the fields, and added to all fields up to the next set of instructions. Because of this, in some cases the instruction text may be broken into several instruction fields, of which only the last portion will currently be extracted, leading to partial instruction text. Likewise, since the instruction is provided for all fields up to the next set of instructions, in some cases the instruction provided may correspond to a previous section in the form. Instruction metadata will be fine-tuned manually for future releases. To ensure instructions are accurately interpreted, please refer to the original form.</p>

*Below we describe how to use the Dictionary Query Tool on the [NBDC portal supported by Lasso](https://nbdc-hbcd-beta.lassoinformatics.com) to download data.*

#### Step 1: Get Started with Approved Access  
Once your **Data Use Certification** has been approved and you’ve completed the required training, you’ll gain access to the **Query Data** tab in Lasso. This tab is conveniently located in the **left-hand side menu**.

#### Step 2: Choose Your Query Method
On the Query Data page, you can toggle between the **Query Wizard** and the **Dictionary Query Tool**. Both tools offer flexible ways to build your queries, letting you choose the approach that best suits your needs.

#### Step 3: Navigate the Dictionary Query Tool
When using the Dictionary Query Tool, you can filter data based on specific instruments or variables. Use the **column filters** or the **global search** to find exactly what you need quickly and efficiently.

#### Step 5: Query the Associated Data
If you need both the data dictionary and the associated data:

* Drag and drop the selected fields into the **Selected Tabular Data** area.  
* Click on **Run Tabular Query**, and the system will generate and download the output file directly to your device in seconds.
